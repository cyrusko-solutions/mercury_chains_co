    <h2 class="text-center">Privacy Policy (WhatsApp Cloud API & General)</h2>
    <div class="info-box">
      <h4>Overview</h4>
      <p>Mercury Chains Co uses WhatsApp Cloud API (provided by Meta/WhatsApp) to send and receive messages for customer support, order updates, booking confirmations, user verification, and related communications. This policy explains what data we collect via WhatsApp integrations, why we collect it, how we store and share it, and your rights.</p>

      <h4>Data we collect</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Phone number you provide when you contact us via WhatsApp.</li>
        <li>Message content you send or receive (text, media you choose to upload like images or documents).</li>
        <li>Message metadata (timestamps, message IDs) and any profile information you share (name, profile photo) available via WhatsApp.</li>
        <li>Order or booking details, verification details, or activation data if you provide them through WhatsApp.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>How we use your data</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>To respond to enquiries, provide customer support, and manage orders or bookings.</li>
        <li>To send verification codes, verification confirmations, and activation confirmations.</li>
        <li>To send transactional messages such as booking confirmations, delivery updates, payment reminders, and order status notifications.</li>
        <li>To maintain records necessary for billing, dispute resolution, and fraud prevention.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>WhatsApp Cloud API & Meta</h4>
      <p>We use the WhatsApp Cloud API, a service run by Meta (WhatsApp). When you message us on WhatsApp, certain data is processed by Meta’s systems. Meta's privacy policies and terms apply to that processing — please see WhatsApp/Meta documentation for details. We do not control Meta's independent processing of data; we only control how we use the data we receive from the API.</p>

      <h5>WhatsApp API Use Cases</h5>
      <p>We use WhatsApp Cloud API strictly for transactional and service-related purposes, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>User Verification:</strong> Sending OTP or verification codes to confirm user identity.</li>
        <li><strong>Verification Confirmation:</strong> Confirming successful verification of your WhatsApp number or account.</li>
        <li><strong>Activation Confirmation:</strong> Notifying you when your account, membership, or service is activated.</li>
        <li><strong>Order Placement Notifications:</strong> Sending order confirmation to customers and notifying hosts/vendors when an order is placed.</li>
        <li><strong>Order Status Updates:</strong> Sending updates related to order processing, approval, rejection, dispatch, delivery, or any required user action.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Data sharing and processors</h4>
      <p>We may share data with:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Service providers who help deliver our service (e.g., payment processors, delivery partners) — only when necessary and under contract.</li>
        <li>Meta (WhatsApp) as part of the API usage; Meta may log transactional metadata for its services.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Retention</h4>
      <p>We retain WhatsApp messages and related records only as long as necessary to provide our services, to comply with legal obligations, or to resolve disputes — typically up to 2 years unless a different retention period is required by law or our operational needs. You can request deletion as described below.</p>

      <h4>Security</h4>
      <p>We take reasonable measures to protect the data we store, including access controls and encrypted backups. However, no system is perfectly secure; avoid sending extremely sensitive personal data over WhatsApp if possible.</p>

      <h4>Your rights</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Access: You can request access to personal data we hold about you.</li>
        <li>Correction: You can ask us to correct inaccurate information.</li>
        <li>Deletion: You can request deletion of your personal data (see Data Deletion Instructions on this site).</li>
        <li>Object: You may object to certain uses of your data.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>How to contact us</h4>
      <p>For privacy questions, access requests, or deletion requests, email: <strong>noreply.mercurychains.co@gmail.com</strong>. Please include the phone number you used with WhatsApp for verification.</p>

      <h4>Consent & updates</h4>
      <p>By contacting us over WhatsApp you consent to the processing described above. We may update this policy; changes will be posted here with an updated date.</p>
